<h1>Privacy Policy for Find A Letter</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 03.10.2024</p>

<p>We, the developers of the Find A Letter game, respect users' right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data and how we use third-party advertising services in our game. Please read this policy carefully.</p>

<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
<p>We do not collect any personal data from users in our game. This means we do not request or store information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.</p>

<h2>2. Data Use</h2>
<p>Since we do not collect any user data, we do not use any data for any purposes.</p>

<h2>3. Advertising</h2>
<p>We use the third-party service Google AdMob to display ads in the game. It’s important to note that the ads may not be personalized, particularly if the game is targeted toward children, in accordance with the Google Play “Families” program policies. The AdMob advertising network may automatically collect non-personal information about your device (such as device model, operating system type, and advertising identifier) to show contextually relevant ads.</p>
<p>You can learn more about how Google AdMob collects and uses data by visiting the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Sharing Data with Third Parties</h2>
<p>Since we do not collect personal data, we do not share any data with third parties. However, third-party services like Google AdMob may collect anonymous data for ad display purposes.</p>

<h2>5. User Rights</h2>
<p>As we do not collect personal data, users do not need to request access or deletion of data. However, you can control ads through your device settings, such as limiting the use of the advertising identifier.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>We do not collect or store any user data. However, we take all necessary measures to ensure that any third-party services we work with (such as AdMob) maintain the security of users' data.</p>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>We comply with all requirements of the Google Play “Families” program and laws aimed at protecting children's data, such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not collect information about children, and we configure ads to comply with these requirements.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. All changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We recommend checking this page periodically to stay informed about any updates.</p>
